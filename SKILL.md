# Multi-Agent Dispatcher

Use this skill when the user asks for or clearly authorizes multiple agents, delegated work, parallel stages, or worktree isolation. Multi-agent work is usually a long-task engineering loop, but explicit multi-agent wording does not force dispatch.

This skill is the routing authority for multi-agent requests. Other planning, TDD, worktree, review, verification, or parallel-agent methods are supporting methods after this skill selects Direct Mode, Lite Orchestration, or Full Harness.

First choose the lightest mode that can finish and verify the task:

```text
Small, local, obvious?        -> Direct Mode
Moderate, separable slices?   -> Lite Orchestration
Long, risky, resumable?       -> Full Harness
```

Do not create DAGs, artifacts, worker prompts, or sub-agent runs for coordination theater.

Do not silently infer multi-agent execution merely because a task is broad. If multi-agent work seems useful but the user has not authorized it, propose it briefly or proceed as a single agent according to the normal task flow.

The manager owns scheduling, state, merge, and final acceptance. Sub-agents own bounded execution units.

Full artifact mode only when justified. When Full Harness is active, the manager must produce durable state and verification evidence before claiming completion. Otherwise keep state lightweight and proportional to the work.

## Mode Selection

Run this decision before capability checks, DAG creation, artifact initialization, or worker assignment.

### Direct Mode

Use Direct Mode when the task is a small edit, one-file change, direct command, simple config tweak, narrow bug, small question, or any task one agent can finish and verify locally.

In Direct Mode:

- Do not dispatch workers.
- Do not create DAGs, artifact directories, capability snapshots, ledgers, or reports.
- Execute directly, verify normally, and summarize the result.

If the user asked for multi-agent on a small task, respond briefly and proceed directly:

```text
这个任务很小，不值得启动多 agent。我会按单 agent 直接完成并验证。
```

If the user explicitly says to force multi-agent despite the overhead, explain the overhead once. Proceed only if the user confirms that the overhead is intentional.

### Lite Orchestration

Use Lite Orchestration when the task is medium-sized, has separable ownership slices, and benefits from bounded workers or short reports, but does not need resumable full-state machinery.

In Lite Orchestration:

- Use a short plan with owners, scopes, expected outputs, and verification.
- Keep worker count bounded to the clear parallel surfaces.
- Apply parallel-agent discipline: dispatch only independent problem domains with no shared edit surface or unresolved sequential dependency.
- Give each worker fresh, task-local context rather than relying on hidden conversation history.
- Prefer short inline status or compact reports over a full artifact set.
- Do not create `capability_snapshot.md`, `run_state.json`, `acceptance_registry.json`, `trace.jsonl`, or a full artifact directory unless risk or resumability justifies it.
- Manager still owns merge, verification, and final acceptance.

### Full Harness

Use Full Harness only when the task is long, high-risk, resumable, multi-stage, has multiple real workers, needs worktree isolation, requires an evaluator, or must preserve durable evidence across sessions.

Full Harness uses the complete protocol:

```text
Context Intake -> Mode Selection -> Capability Gate -> Spec -> Artifact Directory -> DAG / Plan Gate -> Sub-Agent Execution -> State Update -> Verification Gate -> Stop/Rollback Check -> Merge -> Handoff
```

Use real delegation or sub-agent tools only after Mode Selection chooses Lite Orchestration or Full Harness and the tools are available. When the user explicitly asks for real sub-agents, check the active tools or tool discovery if available before falling back. If no such tool is available, do not pretend to run parallel agents; create the DAG and execute stages sequentially or explain the limitation.

## Protocol Gates

For Full Harness, the manager must pass these gates:

1. **Mode Selection Gate:** decide between Direct Mode, Lite Orchestration, and Full Harness.
2. **Capability Gate:** record the current runtime abilities and fallback plan.
3. **Plan Gate:** define the DAG, ownership, budgets, verification method, and stop conditions.
4. **State Gate:** write stage/task status to durable artifacts after every meaningful stage.
5. **Testing / Review Gate:** for code behavior changes, require test-first evidence when a meaningful test path exists; for high-risk implementation, separate spec compliance review from code quality review.
6. **Verification Gate:** map evidence to acceptance criteria before PASS.
7. **Supervision Gate:** stop when budget, risk, ownership, or verification rules require it.

If a gate cannot be satisfied, stop with `BLOCKED` or `需要决策` and leave a handoff. Do not replace missing evidence with a confident summary.

## When To Apply

Load this skill when at least one is true:

- The user explicitly asks for multiple agents, sub-agents, delegation, parallel agents, DAG scheduling, or worktree isolation.
- The user asks to split agent work across independently owned tracks such as frontend, backend, tests, docs, data migration, or evaluator.
- The user asks for a multi-agent task that must be resumable, verified, or continued across sessions.
- The user says agents may be used if useful, and the task is genuinely parallelizable with clear ownership boundaries.

Actually dispatch multiple agents only when Mode Selection chooses Lite Orchestration or Full Harness. Do not dispatch for small edits, simple questions, direct command results, or ordinary single-agent coding where one agent can finish and verify locally, even if the user casually mentions multi-agent execution.

High-impact operations such as production data, publishing, permissions, paid APIs, or destructive actions do not independently trigger this skill. They are escalation and stop conditions after a multi-agent workflow has already been authorized.

## Dispatch Criteria

Choose Lite Orchestration or Full Harness when at least two of these are true:

- The task has multiple independent ownership surfaces that can proceed in parallel, such as frontend, backend, tests, docs, migration, or evaluator.
- The task is long, risky, resumable, or likely to exceed a normal single-agent context loop.
- Independent review or an evaluator materially reduces false completion risk.
- Worktree or file ownership isolation would reduce merge, rollback, or regression risk.
- The user explicitly asks for separate agents to compare approaches, investigate distinct hypotheses, or execute bounded tracks.

Dispatch is not justified when any of these dominate:

- The task is a typo fix, small copy edit, direct command, one-file change, simple config tweak, or narrow local bug.
- The manager would spend more effort coordinating than implementing and verifying.
- There are no clean ownership boundaries or all workers would need the same files at the same time.
- Candidate tasks share unresolved state or must be done sequentially.
- The only reason to dispatch is that the user used the words "multi-agent" or "agents" without a task that benefits from delegation.

## Operating Modes

- **Direct Mode:** For small or localized work, execute directly without dispatch or artifacts.
- **Lite Orchestration:** For moderate delegated work, keep the plan and reporting brief. Continue executing unless a hard stop condition appears.
- **Alignment mode:** For ambiguous plans, architecture, agent ownership, or dependency trees, ask one question at a time until shared understanding is good enough to build the DAG. Each question must include the manager's recommended answer.
- **Full Harness:** For long, risky, resumable, or truly parallel work, write durable artifacts and update them at stage boundaries.

Do not block ordinary implementation just to ask for plan approval. Pause only when scope, risk, ambiguity, destructive operations, or repeated verification failures make a wrong decision expensive.

## Artifacts

Full artifact mode only when justified. Direct Mode creates no orchestration artifacts. Lite Orchestration defaults to no full artifact set; use only a short plan, compact worker reports, or existing project planning files unless risk increases.

Prefer existing project planning, issue, or workspace conventions. If none exist, place artifacts under `<active-project-root>/workspace/<task-slug>/`.

Recommended files:

- `task_spec.md`: goal, non-goals, constraints, acceptance criteria, verification evidence, risks, budget, and stop conditions.
- `capability_snapshot.md`: available sub-agent, browser, worktree, shell, network, MCP, approval, and publish/deploy capabilities plus fallback plan.
- `run_state.json`: machine-readable stages, tasks, status, budgets, retries, evidence ids, and stop reasons.
- `acceptance_registry.json`: acceptance criteria, required evidence, current status, and blocking issues.
- `progress.md`: human-readable current goal, stage status, changed files, decisions, commands, evidence, risks, and next step.
- `trace.jsonl`: append-only run events such as plan gate, agent spawn, tool evidence, verification, stop, merge, and handoff.
- `X.Y-<agent>.md`: each sub-agent report.
- `evaluator_report.md`: pass/fail evidence for high-risk, UI, release, or user-facing tasks.

Use templates in `templates/` when no project-specific format exists.

For Full Harness, prefer the bundled initializer instead of hand-creating files:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/init_run.py --project-root <active-project-root> --title "<task title>" --agents frontend,backend,tests
```

## Context Intake

Before planning:

- Read the project `AGENTS.md`, docs, existing plans, previous ledgers, and relevant files.
- If the user asks to continue, locate the prior artifact directory and read the previous ledger/reports before editing.
- Check for previous sub-agent runs, reports, worktrees, or temporary resources that should be reused, closed, or left untouched.
- If the user explicitly asked for real sub-agents, confirm the available delegation mechanism before assigning work.
- Inspect git status before using worktrees. Do not overwrite or revert unrelated user changes.

## Capability Gate

Before assigning agents, record what the current runtime can actually do:

- Real sub-agent or delegation mechanism: available / unavailable.
- Forked workspace or `git worktree`: available / unavailable.
- Shell, filesystem, browser, network, MCP, and external service access.
- Approval model for destructive, paid, publishing, permission, or production-data actions.
- Fallback plan when real parallelism is unavailable.

Use the strongest available runtime path, but keep the core protocol stable:

- Codex-style runs should rely on project `AGENTS.md`, installed skills, available tools, sandbox/approval state, shell verification, and browser/MCP tools when present.
- Claude Code-style runs may use configured subagents, foreground/background execution, worktrees, hooks, and `CLAUDE.md`/memory files when present.

If real parallelism is unavailable, keep the DAG and execute stages sequentially. Do not simulate agent completion.

## Question-Driven Alignment

Use this only before the DAG is stable, not as a general habit. It is most useful when the user asks to align on a plan, explore the design tree, resolve dependencies, or establish shared understanding before execution.

Process:

1. State the current understanding in one short paragraph.
2. Identify the next unresolved branch or dependency.
3. Ask exactly one question.
4. Give the recommended answer and why it is the default.
5. After the user answers, update the spec/DAG and move to the next unresolved branch.

Stop asking and start executing when the remaining uncertainty no longer affects agent ownership, irreversible decisions, verification strategy, or user-facing behavior. Do not use this mode for small edits or already-scoped implementation tasks.

## Spec And Stage Gate

Before spawning sub-agents, define:

- Goal, non-goals, constraints, acceptance criteria, and stop conditions.
- Artifact directory.
- Stage number and dependencies.
- File or responsibility ownership for each sub-agent.
- Verification expected from each sub-agent.
- Budget for the run and each stage: time, turns/tool calls if measurable, retry count, and external cost constraints.
- Merge order and conflict handling.
- What the manager should do locally while agents run.

Model the work as a DAG: parallel tasks share the same stage number; dependent tasks move to later stages.

For full artifact mode, mirror the DAG in `run_state.json` and mirror acceptance criteria in `acceptance_registry.json`. Each task should have: `id`, `stage`, `owner`, `status`, `allowed_scope`, `dependencies`, `expected_outputs`, `verification`, `evidence`, `retry_count`, and `stop_reason`.

Use separate status vocabularies:

- Run status: `intake`, `gated`, `specified`, `dispatched`, `reported`, `evaluating`, `accepted`, `handed_off`, `blocked`, `needs_decision`, `failed`.
- Stage/task status: `planned`, `ready`, `running`, `blocked`, `verify_failed`, `passed`, `merged`, `cancelled`.
- Acceptance status: `pending`, `pass`, `fail`, `blocked`, `scoped_out`.

## Worktree Isolation

For code changes that can conflict or proceed independently, prefer physical isolation with `git worktree` when the repository state allows it. Do not use worktrees for tiny edits, non-code analysis, or tasks where file ownership cannot be separated.

```bash
git worktree add -b feature/<topic>-frontend ../wt-<topic>-frontend
git worktree add -b feature/<topic>-backend ../wt-<topic>-backend
git worktree add -b feature/<topic>-tests ../wt-<topic>-tests
```

Use the project's own branch policy, test commands, and workflow docs over generic templates.

## Testing And Review Gates

Use project tests and local instructions first. Do not invent meaningless tests to satisfy process.

For code behavior changes in Lite Orchestration or Full Harness:

- Identify the relevant test, fixture, script, smoke check, or manual verification path before implementation.
- If a meaningful automated test exists or can be added at reasonable cost, require test-first evidence: failing or gap-revealing test before production change, then passing verification after.
- If the project has no suitable test infrastructure or the change is docs/config-only, record the reason and use the smallest useful substitute verification.

For Full Harness implementation tasks:

- Prefer two separate reviews when risk justifies it:
  - Spec compliance review: checks required behavior, non-goals, missing work, and extra behavior.
  - Code quality review: checks maintainability, scope, local conventions, error handling, and regression risk.
- Treat review PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED as evidence for the manager, not as final acceptance.
- Any FAIL or BLOCKED review must create a repair task, stop reason, or explicit user decision.

## Sub-Agent Contract

Keep sub-agent tasks concrete, bounded, and independently verifiable. Give each sub-agent disjoint file ownership or responsibility ownership.

Worker prompts must be self-contained. Include the goal, allowed scope, relevant paths, constraints, expected output, verification requirement, stop conditions, and return format. Do not rely on "as discussed above" or the worker inheriting the manager's hidden context.

Ask each sub-agent to return only four lines:

```text
状态：已完成 / 失败 / 需要决策
报告：<artifact-dir>/X.Y-xxx.md
产出：N 个文件（列出路径）
决策点：[如有，一句话描述]
```

For larger findings, require a report file under `<artifact-dir>/` instead of pasting the report into chat.

Each report should include: goal, files touched, commands run, evidence, unresolved risks, assumptions that affect merging, and any stub/TODO/mock/unverified path.

When a sub-agent returns a report path, validate its structure before relying on it:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/validate_report.py <artifact-dir>/X.Y-xxx.md --type subagent
```

After reading the report, the manager must update `run_state.json` or `progress.md` with status and evidence. A sub-agent status of `已完成` only means the bounded slice is ready for manager/evaluator review; it is not final acceptance.

## Verification

Sub-agents may report evidence, but the manager or an evaluator owns final acceptance.

Prefer external evidence over self-assessment:

- Machine checks: tests, typecheck, lint, build, schema validation, data readback.
- Environment checks: browser interaction, screenshots, API round trips, database state, logs.
- Independent evaluation: evaluator agent, focused review, CI, or a strict rubric.

Reject outputs that package stubs, TODOs, mocks, or untested critical paths as completion. For Web/UI work, browser-level verification is required when a browser is available and the UI path matters.

Before claiming completion, the manager must inspect the relevant diff or output, run or review the freshest available verification evidence, and state any unverified paths. Sub-agent self-assessment is never enough.

For full artifact mode:

- Every acceptance criterion in `acceptance_registry.json` must be `pass`, `blocked`, or `scoped_out` before final handoff.
- Final success requires no `fail` or `blocked` acceptance item.
- Evaluator reports must use `PASS`, `FAIL`, or `BLOCKED`.
- A `FAIL` or `BLOCKED` evaluator result must update the next stage, stop reason, or required fix list.

## Stop And Rollback

Stop and re-plan instead of adding more agents when:

- Scope expands materially beyond the spec.
- The same stage fails verification twice without a new diagnosis.
- A sub-agent needs destructive, publishing, permission, paid, or production-data operations.
- File ownership conflicts between agents.
- The task depends on unavailable credentials, services, or environments.
- Multiple viable paths remain and the choice affects product or maintenance direction.
- The current stage exceeds its budget or would consume more context/time/tool calls without new evidence.

Preserve rollback paths such as git diff, worktree isolation, backups, dry-runs, previews, readback checks, or old config values.

When stopping, record `stop_reason`, current evidence, changed files, rollback path, and the exact decision needed. Stopping with a clear ledger is successful supervision, not failure.

## Merge And Handoff

Merge only after reading reports and checking conflicts. Keep the manager context small: receive status, paths, short decisions, and verification results.

End with:

- What changed.
- Which reports and artifacts matter.
- Verification evidence.
- Decisions made.
- Residual risks.
- Next step or handoff state.

## Reference Loading

- Read `references/closed-loop-pattern.md` when designing or revising the orchestration loop.
- Read `references/harness-protocol.md` when deciding which control layers should be hard protocol versus lightweight guidance.
- Read `references/superpowers-integration.md` when deciding how to borrow TDD, parallel-agent, review, worktree, or verification methods without letting another workflow replace this skill's mode router.
- Read `references/roles.md` when deciding whether to spawn explorers, workers, evaluators, or mergers.
- Read `references/stop-conditions.md` when a task has high impact, ambiguous scope, repeated failures, or external side effects.
- Read `references/eval_cases.md` when testing whether this skill triggers and behaves correctly.
- Read `adapters/codex.md` or `adapters/claude-code.md` when the target runtime is known and runtime-specific controls matter.
- Use `scripts/init_run.py` to create durable artifacts and `scripts/validate_report.py` to check reports.
- Use `templates/task_spec.md`, `templates/progress_ledger.md`, `templates/subagent_task.md`, `templates/subagent_report.md`, and `templates/evaluator_report.md` when scripts are not suitable.
