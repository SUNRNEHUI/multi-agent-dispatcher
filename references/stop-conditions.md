# Stop Conditions

Stop and ask for a decision, narrow the scope, or create a new stage when any condition applies.

## Hard Stops

- The task now requires deleting data, publishing, deployment, permission changes, production data access, paid API usage, or irreversible operations.
- The user's stated goals conflict, or acceptance criteria cannot be inferred safely.
- A required dependency, credential, environment, or external service is unavailable.
- The agent is about to revert or overwrite changes it did not make.
- Verification has failed twice for the same stage without a new diagnosis.

## Multi-Agent Stops

- File ownership overlaps between agents and no merge plan exists.
- A sub-agent reports assumptions that contradict the manager's spec or another sub-agent's report.
- Previous worktrees, reports, or temporary resources are still running or contain unmerged work.
- The manager cannot verify a sub-agent's output from its report and evidence.

## Scope Stops

- The implementation requires a larger architecture change than the spec allowed.
- A "small fix" has become a cross-module migration, data model change, or user-facing behavior change.
- More than one viable design remains and the choice affects future product or maintenance direction.

## Quality Stops

- The result depends on stubs, TODOs, mocked data, or placeholder behavior that would be mistaken for real completion.
- Web/UI work has not been checked in a browser when browser verification is available.
- The final answer would need to claim success without tests, logs, screenshots, readback, or another concrete evidence source.

## Budget Stops

- The current stage is consuming too much context, time, tool calls, or external cost relative to the spec.
- Continuing would make the task harder to resume because state has not been written down.

When stopping, leave a concise handoff: current state, evidence, blocker, options, recommendation, and the exact decision needed.
